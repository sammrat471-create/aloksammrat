    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      I’m <strong>Alok Kumar</strong>, known online as <strong>AlokSammrat983</strong> — a 17-year-old entrepreneur, trader, and student who believes that age is never a limit to achieving big dreams. At a remarkably young age, I founded my own brand <strong>LuxeLayer</strong>, which operates under <strong>Sammrat GROUP PVT. LTD</strong>. This venture, valued at over <strong>₹10 crore</strong>, reflects my passion for innovation, business, and creating meaningful impact.
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      From the very beginning, my goal has never been just financial success — it has always been about <strong>making a difference</strong>. Through <strong>LuxeLayer</strong> and other initiatives, I strive to combine creativity, entrepreneurship, and purpose to inspire others and drive positive change.
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      My <strong>mission</strong> is to support the underprivileged and create opportunities that improve lives. A significant part of my company’s revenue is donated to <strong>healthcare</strong>, helping save lives and provide medical aid, and to <strong>education</strong>, ensuring that every child has access to learning and a brighter future. True success is measured not just by wealth, but by the ability to uplift others, spread knowledge, and leave a lasting impact on society.
    </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 30px;">
      At every step of my journey, my vision remains clear — to grow as a learner and a leader, inspire youth, and continue building ventures that make a real difference in the world.
